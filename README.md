# Genie
Genie is the ultimate security solution to prevent confidential data from getting stolen from your device. You can remotely lock your device by just sending an SMS of the appropriate passcode to your device. With the double-layer security offered by Genie, your device has the guarantee of staying protected from others.

How-to
----------
You just have to send your current password as an SMS to your mobile and the device gets locked and it changes your password to a randomly generated string/number. You can retrieve your newly generated password/passcode with your master password setup in the app.

Future Improvements
----------
The passcode should be more customisable by the user. 
In case of other improvements you would like to impose on this app, feel free to give a pull request!
